This project is a simple Instagram-style social media web app built with PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a responsive UI, sidebar navigation, stories, a feed, and a modern "Create Post" modal with live image preview and caption options, all styled for a clean white theme.

To run the project, place it in your web server root (e.g., Instagram), start your server . The code is modular and easy to customize for learning or further development.
